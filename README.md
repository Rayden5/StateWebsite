# StateWebsite
Four pages in total, just a simple website with a form, table, 
Flexbox, float, and basic JavaScript.

The point of this project was to practice basic HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript in a functioning website that reacts to things like 
hovering over links, as seen with the navigation at the top of each 
page, and the bottom of the home page. The website should also be
mostly compatible with every device size, and react depending on 
how small the screen is, with display functionality starting with 
the smallest screen first, and then working toward formatting for 
larger screens. Most formatting was with CSS flex and float, though 
I incorporated a few absolute, relative, and fixed positioning.

The JavaScript added should make sure that the emails provided match, 
but also still give the proper email error if it isn't in an email 
format. Once the form is submitted, a generic message page is shown, 
though no email is actually sent to the email listed. I tried to ensure 
that the form worked regardless of special characters inputed in the 
form fields, even though the information went through a GET request and
sits in the address link of the form webpage.

All images used did not require attribution, and information gotten from 
other sites is in in-text citation and on each page's reference list.
